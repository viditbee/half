"""The composition root: `python -m half` or `half run`.

Everything else in this package is a library. This is the one place that reads
the environment, builds the real transport, and wires the pieces into a running
program — the piece whose absence meant story 2's adapter could not actually be
started.

Credentials are read here and nowhere else, and never written into a store tree
(AD-11): a store is exportable and replayable, so a token inside one would be
handed to the main in an archive and resurrected on every replay.
